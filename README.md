# Dragon-Brick Toolhead 🐉

The Dragon-Brick toolhead was born with toolchanging in mind. What started as a [Dragon Burner](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner) toolhead has become a super compact and sturdy toolhead that features a front mounted PCB as well as sturdy docking points for the MadMax Toolchanger.
